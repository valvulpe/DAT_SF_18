### Course Description
Foundational course in data science, including machine learning theory, case studies and real-world examples, introduction to various modeling techniques, and other tools to make predictions and decisions about data. Students will gain practical computational experience by running machine learning algorithms and learning how to choose the best and most representative data models to make predictions. Students will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) throughout this course.

### Required Setup
- Own laptop
- [Continuum Analytics Anaconda python](http://continuum.io/downloads)
- [Git & Github](https://github.com/)

### Completion Requirements
In order to receive a General Assembly Letter of Completion for Data Science, upon completion of the course, students must:

- Complete and submit 80% of all course assignments (homework, homework reviews, labs, quizzes). Students who miss more than 20% of assignments will not be eligible for the course certificate.
- Attend at least 80% of classes (miss no more than 4 classes)
- Complete and subimt the course midterm test.
- Complete and submit the course final project, completing all functional and technical requirements on the project rubric, including delivering a presentation.

Assignments, milestones and feedback throughout the course are designed to prepare students to deliver a quality course project.
